# 6502_computer
6502 computer built in logisim following tutorials of Ben Eater on how to make a "real 6502 computer" on a breadboard.

I am using a logisim library from https://github.com/SolraBizna/logi6502 which comes with multiple version 65c02 mp.
Current This project is not working as I want it, I dont have IO. Ben uses a VIA(Versitile Interface Adapter) 65c22 to output messages onto a screen,
But I haven't figured how to do it.
